## Why Did Nitrite Drop Over the Weekend?

**Clue:** The boiler didnâ€™t run. No feedwater was added. So where did the nitrite go?

**Field Logic Snap:**
- Residual oxygen leaks in over time (vents, feed tank)
- No circulation = stratification = corrosion in stagnant zones
- Nitrite reacts slowly, even when boiler is idle

ðŸ§  Snap takeaway: Test after idle weekends. You may need a re-feed strategy if nitrite always dips Monday morning.
