# SnapPrecise Calculator

Welcome to the **SnapPrecise Dosage Calculator** – designed to help field reps quickly estimate dosing requirements based on system volume, product concentration, and desired ppm.

## 💧 Input Fields

- **System Volume (USG)**  
- **Target PPM**  
- **Product Strength (% or mg/L active)**  
- **Dose Frequency (daily, weekly, etc.)**

## 📈 What You'll Get

- Gallons or liters of product to add
- Estimated time to depletion (based on runtime)
- Alerts for underdosing or early depletion
- Field logic: e.g., "You're underfeeding by 20% — runtime should be adjusted."

## 🛠️ Coming soon: Live React-based widget embedded right here!
